# LoveJob

LoveJob is a Full Stack Web App written in Angular + Bootstrap (and also CSS) for the Front-End part and in ASP.NET Core with C# using Microsoft SQL Server for the API and the Back-End part.

The App is designed for two types of users:

- **Job seekers**: those who are looking for their dream job and have the opportunity to register and create an account by selecting their current job position.
- **Companies**: those who work for a company (recruiters) and are looking for an employee to fill a specific job position required within the company.

Once successfully logged in, you will access the main page of the app, which is the search section. Here, you can search by area, city, street, or ZIP code, and you can view markers representing the open positions uploaded by companies. You can apply to these positions, add them to your favorites, or contact the person who posted the job advertisement.

Of course, there are two sections related to managing favorites and chatting with companies/workers. Lastly, you can find the page related to your account if you want to customize it by modifying certain fields.

There is also the option to register a user as an admin by changing the value of "Role" during registration from the backend. By doing so, they can access an additional section called "Feedbacks," which contains all the feedback submitted by non-admin users (or regular users) regarding the app.

## Run Locally

To run locally this app you must clone the project on your PC. Then you should first start the server and once the Swagger API page loads up you can start the client and that's it!
